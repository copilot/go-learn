# Learning Go (for fun â€“ with tests)

I just want to try learning Golang (Go) as an exercise and use TDD to do it. I found the following repo and liked the theory, plus it forces me to really give TDD a shot. It is something that I've read about but have never fully committed to.

I don't know how long I will stick with it or how useful this is to anyone else, but I might as well keep the repo while I give it a go. ðŸ˜‚

### Thoughts so far...

2019-08-28 - first lesson done and the language seems odd coming from C#/JS in terms of syntax. Lack of parentheses and semi-colons are driving me mad. Habits are hard to break. Also I don't know if I like the go linter I installed in VS code. It forced me to add a pretty pointless comment to the first function I added and I don't really understand why yet.

2019-08-30 - integers, looping, documentation, benchmarking.  Pretty cool how those last two are built-in â€“ that's handy. I like that the iteration lesson has practice exercises at the end.  I hope that the rest do as well.  I learned a ton more than just iteration because of those extra practice pieces. I know I'm jumping ahead but starting to realize how different go is makes me like it even more. A totally re-thought way of managing errors.  And MULTI-returns!  That's wild.

2020-01-17 - ok. got busy at work, new computer, holidays, etcâ€¦  Where was I, oh yes, just let me figure out how to run my previous code. `go run hello.go` huh â€” it worked. Now I just need to do a quick skim and get back to where I was. My plan now is to hit this once a week on Friday for an hour until i finish the series. I'm giving myself 28 weeks. We shall see.

I got part way through lesson four with some interruptions. Hopefully I'll make better progress next week.
