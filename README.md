# Learning Go (for fun â€“ with tests)

Just want to try this out as an exercise. Found the following repo and I liked the theory, plus it forces me to really give TDD a shot. Something that I've read about but have never fully committed to.

https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests/

I don't know how long I will stick with it or how useful this is to anyone else, but I might as well keep the repo while I give it a go.

### Thoughts so far...

2019-08-28 - first lesson done and the language seems odd coming from C#/JS in terms of syntax. Lack of curly brackets and  semi-colons are driving me mad. Habits are hard to break. Also I don't know if I like the go linter I installed in VS code. It forced me to add a pretty pointless comment to the first function I added and I don't really understand why yet.
